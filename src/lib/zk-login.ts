// MANUAL STEPS AND CONSIDERATIONS:

// 1. Set up a zkLogin provider:
//    - You'll need to set up an account with a zkLogin provider (e.g., Google, Facebook)
//    - Obtain the necessary API keys and configure your application

// 2. Server-side implementation:
//    - Set up a secure server to handle zkLogin callbacks and proof verification
//    - Implement proper error handling and logging for debugging issues at scale

// 3. Database setup:
//    - Design a scalable database schema to store user information and Sui addresses
//    - Consider using a distributed database system for high availability and performance

// 4. Security considerations:
//    - Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
//    - Use HTTPS for all communications
//    - Securely store and manage API keys and secrets

// 5. Scalability:
//    - Design your system to handle millions of users
//    - Consider using load balancers and a microservices architecture
//

// 6. Performance optimization:
//    - Implement caching mechanisms to reduce database load
//    - Optimize database queries and indexes for fast lookups

// 7. Compliance and regulations:
//    - Ensure compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA)
//    - Implement proper data retention and deletion policies

// 8. User experience:
//    - Design a smooth onboarding process for users new to zkLogin
//    - Provide clear instructions and error messages throughout the login flow

// 9. Monitoring and analytics:
//    - Set up comprehensive logging and monitoring systems
//    - Implement analytics to track user adoption and identify potential issues

// 10. Fallback mechanisms:
//     - Implement alternative authentication methods in case of zkLogin failures
//     - Design a system to handle temporary outages of the zkLogin provider

// 11. Testing and quality assurance:
//     - Develop a comprehensive test suite, including unit tests and integration tests
//     - Perform load testing to ensure the system can handle high concurrent users

// 12. Documentation and support:
//     - Create detailed documentation for developers and support staff
//     - Set up a support system to handle user inquiries and issues

// Remember, implementing zkLogin for a large-scale project requires careful planning,
// robust architecture, and ongoing maintenance. Regular security audits and
// performance reviews are crucial to ensure the system remains secure and efficient
// as it scales to millions of users.
